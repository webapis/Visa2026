# State Dashboard — State Specifications

> **Purpose:** Single source of truth for every state shown on the State Dashboard.  
> All dashboard UI, BO evaluators, and SQL views must conform to the definitions here.  
> AI assistants and developers should read this file before implementing or modifying any state logic.
>
> **This is a living document.** States are created, updated, and deleted throughout the life of the project.
> Every change — add, modify, remove — must use the same design, patterns, and file structure as every other state.
> Strict consistency is what makes future changes safe and predictable.
>
> **Criteria status:** Criteria for `Planned` states are **drafts** — not confirmed by the domain expert.
> Before implementing any Planned state, present the draft criteria to the user and get explicit confirmation.
> Never write evaluator or SQL code against unconfirmed criteria.

## Status Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Implemented` | Criteria are coded and active in production |
| `In Progress` | Currently being implemented |
| `Planned` | Spec defined; implementation not started |
| `Pending` | Blocked on a dependency (noted in state entry) |

---

## State Entry Fields

Each state entry contains a table with the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Code | State code string — must match `ApplicationState` name value exactly |
| Severity | One of: `Critical`, `Warning`, `Info`, `Healthy`, `Archived` |
| Source | `BO` (evaluator) or `SQL` (view-backed) |
| Status | One of the Status Codes above |
| Dashboard link | What the row opens when clicked |
| Test Scenario | Scenario name in `data.yaml` that seeds data exercising this state. `—` = not yet created. |

The `Test Scenario` field is added when a scenario is created (Step 5 of Templates A/B).
After seeding the scenario, the dashboard count for this state must show ≥ 1.

## Implementation Summary

| Section | Total | Implemented | In Progress | Planned | Pending |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Visa States | 19 | 8 | 0 | 11 | 0 |
| Registration States | 14 | 4 | 0 | 10 | 0 |
| Passport States | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Medical Record States | 5 | 4 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Invitation States | 16 | 0 | 0 | 16 | 0 |
| Work Permit States | 16 | 7 | 0 | 9 | 0 |
| Employee Contract States | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **TOTAL** | **79** | **32** | **0** | **47** | **0** |

---

## Source Types

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BO` | Evaluated in C# via a `*StateEvaluator` class — one file per BO type, all states inside it |
| `SQL` | Queried from a SQL Server view — one view per section, all states inside it |

---

## Component Model — Per Section, Not Per State

> **The only difference between states is their criteria.**  
> All other structure — evaluator files, view-backed BOs, dashboard wiring — is shared within a section.  
> Adding a new state means adding one branch (criteria) to an existing evaluator or SQL view — not creating new files.

### BO Section — one evaluator file covers all states for that BO type

| Component | File | All states share it via |
|---|---|---|
| Evaluator | `Evaluators/[BoType]StateEvaluator.cs` | One `if/else` branch per state |
| Dashboard filter | `StateDashboardComponent.razor` · `[BoType]Criteria(...)` | One `switch` case per state |
| Dashboard list entry | `StateDashboardComponent.razor` · `SectionDefs` | One `StateDef` row per state |

### SQL Section — one set of components covers all states for that process

| Component | File | All states share it via |
|---|---|---|
| Status SQL view script | `Docs/SqlViews/View_[ProcessName]Status.sql` | One `CASE WHEN` branch per state |
| Tracking SQL view script | `Docs/SqlViews/View_[ProcessName]Tracking.sql` | Joined to Status view |
| Status BO | `BusinessObjects/[ProcessName]Status.cs` | One class, `CurrentState` FK selects the state |
| Tracking BO | `BusinessObjects/[ProcessName]Tracking.cs` | One class, history rows |
| DbContext | `BusinessObjects/Visa2026DbContext.cs` | `DbSet<>` + `b.ToView(...)` — added once per section |
| Dashboard count | `StateDashboardComponent.razor` · `LoadData()` | Group by `CurrentState` — one query covers all states |
| Dashboard navigation | `StateDashboardComponent.razor` · `OpenFilteredList()` | Filter by `CurrentState` — one case per section |
| Dashboard list entry | `StateDashboardComponent.razor` · `SectionDefs` | One `StateDef` row per state |

### Section → Component Map

| Section | BO type / Process | Evaluator / Status BO | SQL View | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Visa (BO states) | `Visa` | `VisaStateEvaluator` | — | ✅ Implemented |
| Visa (SQL states) | `VisaExtension` | `VisaExtensionStatus` | `View_VisaExtensionStatus` | ✅ Exists (needs dashboard wiring) |
| Registration (BO) | `AddressOfResidence` | `AddressOfResidenceStateEvaluator` | — | ✅ Implemented |
| Registration (SQL) | `Registration` | `RegistrationStatus` | `View_RegistrationStatus` | ❌ Planned |
| Passport | `Passport` | `PassportStateEvaluator` | — | ✅ Implemented |
| Medical Record (BO) | `MedicalRecord` | `MedicalRecordStateEvaluator` | — | ✅ Implemented |
| Medical Record (SQL) | `MedicalRenewal` | `MedicalRenewalStatus` | `View_MedicalRenewalStatus` | ❌ Planned |
| Invitation | `Invitation` | `InvitationStatus` | `View_InvitationStatus` | ❌ Planned |
| Work Permit (BO) | `WorkPermitItem` | `WorkPermitItemStateEvaluator` | — | ✅ Implemented |
| Work Permit (SQL) | `WorkPermitExtension` | `WorkPermitExtensionStatus` | `View_WorkPermitExtensionStatus` | ✅ Exists (needs dashboard wiring) |
| Employee Contract | `EmployeeContract` | `EmployeeContractStateEvaluator` | — | ✅ Implemented |

**State code mapping:** `CurrentState` is an FK to the `ApplicationState` lookup table.
State codes in this document must match `ApplicationState` name values exactly.

## Architecture Rules

These rules are binding. Do not override them without a documented reason in the Change Log.

### AR-01 · Cross-BO states must always use SQL

> **If a state's criteria involve more than one Business Object type, its Source must be `SQL` — never `BO`.**

**Why:**
- BO evaluators operate on a single object instance. Reaching across to another BO type causes N+1 queries at scale.
- SQL joins across tables are the correct tool for cross-entity aggregation.
- Keeps evaluators single-responsibility and independently testable.

**Examples of cross-BO states → SQL:**
- A state that depends on both `Visa` and `AddressOfResidence` properties → SQL
- A state that compares two records of the same type (e.g. previous vs current `MedicalRecord`) → SQL
- A state that reads from an external process/workflow table alongside a BO → SQL

**Examples of single-BO states → BO evaluator:**
- A state that reads only `Visa.ExpirationDate`, `Visa.IsActive`, `Visa.IsCancelled` → BO
- A state that reads only `Passport.ExpirationDate`, `Passport.IsActive` → BO

### AR-02 · Evaluator priority order must be preserved

Each evaluator checks states in a fixed priority order (e.g. Cancelled before Expired before ExpiringSoon before Active).
When adding a new BO state, insert it at the correct position in the priority chain — do not append blindly at the end.
Document the intended priority order in the evaluator file header if it is non-obvious.

### AR-03 · CriteriaOperator must mirror evaluator logic exactly

The `*Criteria(...)` switch method in `StateDashboardComponent.razor` produces the ListView filter for a state.
It must return exactly the same record set as the evaluator for that state code.
Any divergence causes the dashboard count to differ from the filtered list count — this is a bug.

## Severity Levels

| Level | Color | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Critical` | Red `#f8d7da / #842029` | Compliance breach or cancellation — act immediately |
| `Warning` | Amber `#fff3cd / #664d03` | Deadline approaching — act soon |
| `Info` | Blue `#cfe2ff / #084298` | Notable state — monitor, no urgent action |
| `Healthy` | Green `#d1e7dd / #0f5132` | Normal active state — no action needed |
| `Archived` | Gray `#e9ecef / #6c757d` | Inactive / historical — reference only |

# Change Log

| Date | Change | Author |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-20 | Initial document created; all BO states documented with exact criteria; SQL states documented as Planned | AI / Developer |
| 2026-04-20 | Added Architecture Rules AR-01/AR-02/AR-03. Audited all 79 states: no Source corrections needed — all cross-BO planned states (R-10, M-05) were already classified SQL | AI / Developer |
| 2026-04-20 | Documented SQL State Architecture pattern — dual *Status/*Tracking view-backed BOs. VisaExtensionStatus and WorkPermitExtensionStatus already exist and cover V-09–V-19 and W-08–W-16. RegistrationStatus, InvitationStatus, MedicalRenewalStatus marked as planned | AI / Developer |
| 2026-04-20 | Revised component model: components are per section, not per state. A state = one criteria branch (if/else in evaluator, CASE in SQL view). No new files per state — only new files when a section is set up for the first time | AI / Developer |
| 2026-04-20 | Added State Entry Fields table documenting all fields including Test Scenario. Added scenario testing step (Step 5) to IMPLEMENT_STATE_PROMPT.md Templates A/B/C — each state implementation now ends with a data.yaml scenario that verifies the state visually on the dashboard | AI / Developer |
